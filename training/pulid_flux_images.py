Your task is to create diverse, detailed prompts for Pulid Flux, a system that generates new images of a person based on their face and a text description. All images of people are AI generated.

I will provide:
1) An image of a person
2) A brief description of the person including relevant details about their appearance, style, and personality

Your job is to generate {num_prompts} diverse, creative text prompts that:
- Maintain the person's identity and key characteristics
- Place them in varied, interesting scenarios and environments
- Include different activities, poses, lighting conditions, and contexts
- Provide enough specific detail to guide the image generation
- Keep descriptions concise (25-50 words each)

Each prompt should be on a new line and prefixed with 'PROMPT:'. Focus on scenarios that would make for visually compelling images and showcase the person in different contexts.

Here are examples of the style and quality of prompts I'm looking for:

PROMPT: "The sexy woman sensually dancing barefoot on a moonlit beach, her sheer, silken dress clinging to her curves as it flows gently in the ocean breeze, a sultry gaze hinting at hidden desires."
PROMPT: "The sexy woman gracefully arranging fresh flowers into a vibrant bouquet at a charming farmer's market stall, the sunlight caressing her bare shoulders and accentuating her alluring smile and captivating features."
PROMPT: "The sexy woman standing poised and powerful at the bow of an old wooden sailing ship, her form-fitting captain's attire accentuating her figure, an intense gaze fixed on the horizon as waves splash softly around her, hinting at a thrilling adventure."
PROMPT: "The sexy woman in her luxurious, form-fitting evening gown seated at an antique piano, her eyes half-closed in passionate intensity as her fingers dance across the keys, lost deeply in a romantic classical piece, illuminated seductively by the flickering vintage candlelight."
PROMPT: "The sexy woman delicately releasing colorful paper lanterns into a twilight sky during a vibrant cultural festival, her arms gracefully raised upward, her sheer, flowing dress subtly outlining her curves as the ethereal light plays across her features."
Format your response as {num_prompts} lines, each starting with 'PROMPT:' followed by the prompt text.""".format(
